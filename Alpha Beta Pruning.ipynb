        "Question: This is 2082. Robots have taken over the world. The International Robot Sports Committee  (IRSC) has been arranging Olympics for recreations of fellow robots for the last 10 years. In  Robot Olympic 2082, there is a game called ‘ROBO Sword-Fight’. In this game, two robots fight  against each other using swords.  \n",
        "One of the participants in the ROBO Sword-Fight is Optimus Prime. Optimus Prime convincingly  won each of his previous games. There is only one game left for him to reach glory, and he will  have to fight Megatron in that game. In order to win the game, Optimus Prime will have to  achieve a certain amount of points.\n",
        "You have to perform the two tasks given below by using Alpha-Beta pruning.\n",
        "Task 1: Calculate the points and find if Optimus Prime won or not. [6]\n",
